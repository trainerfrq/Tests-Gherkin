Narrative:
As a caller operator having an active DA basic call with a callee operator
I want to change mission
So I can verify that the DA basic call is not affected by this action

Meta: @AfterStory: ../includes/@SwitchToInitialMission.story

Scenario: Booking profiles
Given booked profiles:
| profile | group | host           | identifier |
| javafx  | hmi   | <<CLIENT1_IP>> | HMI OP1    |
| javafx  | hmi   | <<CLIENT2_IP>> | HMI OP2    |
| javafx  | hmi   | <<CLIENT3_IP>> | HMI OP3    |

Scenario: Define call queue items
Given the call queue items:
| key     | source      | target      | callType |
| OP1-OP2 | <<OP1_URI>> | <<OP2_URI>> | DA/IDA   |
| OP2-OP1 | <<OP2_URI>> | <<OP1_URI>> | DA/IDA   |

Scenario: Caller establishes an outgoing call
When HMI OP1 presses DA key OP2
Then waiting for 3 seconds
Then HMI OP1 has the DA key OP2 in state out_ringing

Scenario: Callee client receives the incoming call
Then HMI OP2 has the DA key OP1 in state inc_initiated

Scenario: Change mission for HMI OP2
When HMI OP2 with layout <<LAYOUT_MISSION2>> presses function key MISSIONS
Then HMI OP2 changes current mission to mission MAN-NIGHT-TACT
Then HMI OP2 activates mission
Then waiting for 5 seconds

Scenario: Verify call state for both operators
		  @REQUIREMENTS: GID-3005111
Then HMI OP1 has the call queue item OP2-OP1 in state out_ringing
Then HMI OP2 has the call queue item OP1-OP2 in state inc_ringing

Scenario: Callee client answers the incoming call
Then HMI OP2 accepts the call queue item OP1-OP2

Scenario: Verify call is connected for both operators
Then HMI OP1 has the call queue item OP2-OP1 in state connected
Then HMI OP2 has the call queue item OP1-OP2 in state connected

Scenario: Change mission for HMI OP1
When HMI OP1 with layout <<LAYOUT_MISSION1>> presses function key MISSIONS
Then HMI OP1 changes current mission to mission WEST-EXEC
Then HMI OP1 activates mission
Then waiting for 5 seconds

Scenario: Verify call state for both operators
		  @REQUIREMENTS: GID-3005111
Then HMI OP1 has the call queue item OP2-OP1 in state connected
Then HMI OP2 has the call queue item OP1-OP2 in state connected
Then waiting for 1 second

Scenario: Clear call
Then HMI OP1 terminates the call queue item OP2-OP1
Then HMI OP2 has in the call queue a number of 0 calls
Then HMI OP1 has in the call queue a number of 0 calls

Scenario: A scenario that is only executed in case of an execution failure
